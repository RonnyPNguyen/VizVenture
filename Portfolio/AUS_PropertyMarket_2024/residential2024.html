				Average age of first-time home owners is increasing. The elderly has an

				In the Census data of 2021, millennials are less likely to own a home,
				compared to the older generations in the same age group. More than half
				of the Baby Boomer owns a home as early as 25 to 29 years old. The rate
				is only 36% for the youngest Millennials, born from 1992 - 1996.

				The median age of first-time home buyers is increasing. In 2024, the age
				is 36 while in 1970s, it was just 25.7. It takes the Gen X 15 years at
				the age of 49 to achieve the same rate as the Baby Boomers at 34, and
				the disparity continue for the Millennials since only 59% of them own a
				house at peak.

			<p class="copy-heading">
				Are the elderly taking away future generation's opportunity?
			</p>
			<p class="copy-content">
				Owning a property through retirement funds (Self-managed Super Fund) has
				certain advantages:
				<br />• Once it produce rental income, it is taxed at 15% <br />• If the
				property is sold after 12 months, 10% capital gain tax is applied
				<br />• Sold within 12 months and under transfer balance cap of A$1.9m,
				no capital gain tax applied <br />
				Unlike the US where it is costly to buy real estate through the IRA,
				owning a property through superannuation in Australia only has a
				effective tax rate of 10%. And it is quite easy to do so that it is
				often encouraged. To some extent, this SMSF scheme is mostly beneficial
				for the elderly whose superannuation funds are stacked up, making owning
				second or third property easier.
			</p>
			<p class="copy-heading">What are the reasons?</p>
			<p class="copy-content">
				First home buyer are more likely to be turned down by a lender than the
				at approximately 50 - 60% of success rate compared to 80% for the last 2
				years, according to Equifax. These applicants, who age from 25 to 44,
				are reported to be waiting for the interest rate to drop before applying
				for their first home loan.
